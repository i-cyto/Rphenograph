Description: A simple R implementation of the phenograph [PhenoGraph](http://
    www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(15)00637-6) algorithm, which is a
    clustering method designed for high-dimensional single-cell data analysis.
    It works by creating a graph ("network") representing phenotypic similarities
    between cells by calculating the Jaccard coefficient between nearest-neighbor
    sets, and then identifying communities using the well known ["Louvain method"]
    (https://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/) in this graph.
    H. Chen created and published this package.
    S. Thomas Kelly added pruning and graphs clustering methods.
    Etienne K. Becht added approximate HNSW nearest neighbors for speed.
